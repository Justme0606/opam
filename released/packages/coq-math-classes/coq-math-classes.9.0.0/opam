synopsis: "A library of abstract interfaces for mathematical structures in Coq"
description: """
Math classes is a library of abstract interfaces for mathematical
structures, such as:

*  Algebraic hierarchy (groups, rings, fields, …)
*  Relations, orders, …
*  Categories, functors, universal algebra, …
*  Numbers: N, Z, Q, …
*  Operations, (shift, power, abs, …)

It is heavily based on Coq’s new type classes in order to provide:
structure inference, multiple inheritance/sharing, convenient
algebraic manipulation (e.g. rewriting) and idiomatic use of
notations.
