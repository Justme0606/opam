synopsis: "Ring, field, lra, nra, and psatz tactics for Mathematical Components"
description: """
This library provides `ring`, `field`, `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics for
the Mathematical Components library. These tactics use the algebraic
structures defined in the MathComp library and their canonical instances for
the instance resolution, and do not require any special instance declaration,
like the `Add Ring` and `Add Field` commands. Therefore, each of these tactics
works with any instance of the respective structure, including concrete
instances declared through Hierarchy Builder, abstract instances, and mixed
concrete and abstract instances, e.g., `int * R` where `R` is an abstract
commutative ring. Another key feature of Algebra Tactics is that they
automatically push down ring morphisms and additive functions to leaves of
ring/field expressions before applying the proof procedures."""
